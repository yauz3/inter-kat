# Reference Implementation of Inter-KAT algorithm
This readme file documents all of the required steps to run Inter-KAT.

Note that the code was implemented and tested on a Linux operating system only.

## How to set up the environment
We have provided an Anaconda environment file for easy setup.
If you do not have Anaconda installed, you can get Miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Create the `cobdock-env` environment using the following command:
```bash
conda env create -n kat_env -f environment.yml
conda activate kat_env
```
